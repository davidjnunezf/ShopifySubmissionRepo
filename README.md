# MobileChallengeSubmission

Hello Shopify Team! This is my submission for the 2020 IOS intern application

Clima is an app that takes real time weather data in real time from the website openweathermap.org in the form of a JSON file.

This application will display the weather to the user initially based on their GPS location. However the user also 
has the option to search up the weather in other cities.

Here some Screenshots of my Application
